## Hi, I'm Melvin👋

📃 **About Me**

I'm a data scientist who enjoys building statistical and machine learning models to solve complex problems. My path started with a Mathematics degree, driven by the satisfaction of tackling difficult problems and appreciating the structure and beauty of math. That same curiosity fuels my work in data science, where I enjoy the creative process of feature engineering, model selection, and data storytelling. Outside of work, I've drawwn inspiration from films like *Moneyball*, *The Matrix*, and  all of which highlight the power of data, logic, and creativity in shaping outcomes.
