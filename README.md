# Melvin Adkins
Data Scientist | Statistical Modeling & ML Pipelines

## 💫 About Me:
I'm a data scientist with a strong foundation in mathematics, focused on building statistical and machine learning models that solve real-world problems. My work spans exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model development, and rigorous evaluation, with an emphasis on interpretability, sound methodology, and measurable impact.

I've applied these skills across academic research, federal analytics, and business-oriented projects, tackling problems in time series forecasting, classification and segmentation, NLP, anomaly detection, and large-scale data processing. I'm particularly interested in how data informs user behavior, personalizes experiences, and supports strategic decision-making across diverse industries.

## 🚀 Highlighted Projects:

### ⚕️ Predicting Heart Disease with Logistic Regression 
Built a logistic regression model using the Framingham Heart Study dataset to predict 10-year coronary heart disease risk. Implemented preprocessing, class imbalance handling, feature importance analysis, and threshold optimization to improve precision-recall balance beyond the default 0.50 cutoff.

**Key Techniques:** Logistic Regression • Threshold Optimization • ROC-AUC • Class Imbalance Handling
