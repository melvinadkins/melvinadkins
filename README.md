# Hi, I'm Melvin!👋 
Data Scientist with Mathematics Background | Statistical Modeling & ML Pipelines

## 💫 About Me:
I’m a data scientist with a strong foundation in mathematics and a passion for building statistical and machine learning models that solve real-world problems. My work spans exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and rigorous evaluation with an emphasis on interpretability and sound methodology.

I’ve applied these skills across academic research, federal government, and fintech-related projects, including time series forecasting, classification modeling/segmentation, NLP, anomaly detection, and large-scale data workflows. I'm particularly interested in how data informs user behavior, digital experiences, and decision-making across industries.
